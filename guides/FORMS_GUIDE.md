## Overview

The Form Management module allows administrators to create dynamic forms with various field types, version control, and department-based access. This guide covers both creating forms (for administrators) and submitting forms (for users).

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Form Builder** - Create custom forms with 10+ field types
- **Form Versioning** - Complete version control with activation management
- **Department-based Access** - Granular form access control by organizational units
- **API Integration** - Dynamic dropdown options from external data sources
- **Form Prefilling** - Auto-populate forms based on user context

## For Administrators: Creating Forms

### Step 1: Create a New Form

1. Navigate to **Forms** in the sidebar
2. Click **"Create New Form"**
3. Fill in the form details:
   - **Form Number**: Unique identifier (e.g., `FORM-001`)
   - **Name**: Descriptive name
   - **Description**: Purpose of the form
   - **Departments**: Select which departments can access this form
   - **Requires Approval**: Check if submissions need approval

4. Click **"Create Form"**

### Step 2: Create a Form Version

Forms use version control to track changes over time.

1. From the form details page, click **"Create New Version"**
2. Enter version notes (what changed in this version)
3. Click **"Create Version"**

### Step 3: Add Form Fields

Click **"Add Field"** and configure the field properties.

#### Basic Field Configuration

Every field requires:

- **Label**: Field name shown to users
- **Name**: Internal field identifier (no spaces, use underscores)
- **Required**: Whether field is mandatory
- **Help Text**: Guidance for users (optional)
- **Validation**: Field-specific validation rules

#### Field Display Options

- **Width**: Full width or half width (for side-by-side fields)
- **Order**: Fields display in order (can be reordered)
- **Conditional Display**: Show/hide based on other field values

### Step 4: Activate Version

1. Once all fields are added, click **"Activate Version"**
2. This version becomes the active form for users
3. Only one version can be active at a time
4. Previous versions remain accessible for reference

## API-Sourced Dropdowns

For dynamic dropdown options from external systems, configure an API source in the field settings.

### Basic Configuration

When editing a Select field, configure the API source:

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.example.com/employees",
  "method": "GET",
  "value_field": "id",
  "label_field": "name",
  "cache_ttl": 300
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | Yes | API endpoint URL |
| `method` | No | HTTP method (GET, POST). Default: GET |
| `value_field` | Yes | Field name for option value |
| `label_field` | Yes | Field name for option label |
| `data_path` | No | Path to data array (e.g., `data.employees`) |
| `auth` | No | Authentication configuration |
| `params` | No | Query parameters or request body |
| `headers` | No | Additional HTTP headers |
| `timeout` | No | Request timeout (1-300 seconds) |
| `cache_ttl` | No | Cache duration (60-3600 seconds) |

### Combined Labels

Create descriptive labels by combining multiple fields:

**Examples:**
- `{name} - {department}` → "John Doe - HR"
- `{first_name} {last_name}` → "John Doe"
- `{name} ({position})` → "John Doe (Manager)"

### Authentication Types

#### No Authentication
```json
{
  "url": "https://api.example.com/public-data",
  "value_field": "id",
  "label_field": "name"
}
```

#### Bearer Token
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "bearer",
    "token": "your-bearer-token"
  }
}
```

#### Basic Authentication
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "basic",
    "username": "api-user",
    "password": "api-password"
  }
}
```

#### API Key
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "api_key": "your-api-key",
    "header_name": "X-API-Key"
  }
}
```

### TomSelect Enhancement

## Calculated Fields

Use formulas to automatically calculate values based on other fields.

### Available Functions

**Mathematical Operations:**
- `SUM(field1, field2, field3, ...)` - Add values
- `MULTIPLY(field1, field2)` - Multiply values
- `DIVIDE(field1, field2)` - Divide values
- `SUBTRACT(field1, field2)` - Subtract values
- `AVERAGE(field1, field2, field3, ...)` - Calculate average

**Logical Operations:**
- `IF(condition, true_value, false_value)` - Conditional logic

### Formula Examples

**Simple Total:**
```
SUM(item1_cost, item2_cost, item3_cost)
```

**Line Total:**
```
MULTIPLY(quantity, unit_price)
```

**Discount Calculation:**
```
IF(total > 1000, MULTIPLY(total, 0.1), 0)
```

**Net Amount:**
```
SUBTRACT(gross_amount, discount_amount)
```

**Complex Example:**
```
IF(
  quantity > 100,
  MULTIPLY(quantity, unit_price, 0.9),
  MULTIPLY(quantity, unit_price)
)
```

### Tips for Calculated Fields

1. **Field Names**: Use exact field names (as defined in the Name field)
2. **Real-time**: Calculations update as users type
3. **Read-only**: Calculated fields cannot be manually edited
4. **Validation**: Ensure source fields are numeric
5. **Order**: Place calculated fields after their source fields
