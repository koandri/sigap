## For Administrators: Creating Workflows

### Step 1: Create Workflow

1. Navigate to a form's details page
2. Click **"Approval Workflows"**
3. Click **"Create Workflow"**
4. Fill in workflow details:
   - **Name**: Workflow identifier (e.g., "Standard Approval")
   - **Description**: Purpose of workflow
   - **Active**: Whether this workflow is currently in use

5. Click **"Create"**

### Step 2: Add Approval Steps

Each workflow consists of one or more approval steps.

#### Adding a Step

1. Click **"Add Step"**
2. Configure step properties:

**Basic Configuration:**
- **Step Number**: Order of approval (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Step Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Supervisor Review")
- **Description**: What this step validates

**Approver Configuration:**
- **Approver Type**: 
  - Specific User
  - Any user with Role
  - Department Head
  - Form Creator's Manager
- **Approver**: Select user or role

**Requirements:**
- **Required**: Is this step mandatory?
  - Required steps must be completed
  - Optional steps can be skipped
- **Auto-approve**: Skip if certain conditions met

**SLA Configuration:**
- **SLA (hours)**: Time limit for approval
- **Escalate**: Auto-escalate if overdue
- **Escalate To**: Who receives escalation (usually manager)

3. Click **"Save Step"**

#### Step Order

- **Sequential**: Steps execute in numerical order (1, 2, 3...)
- **Parallel**: Multiple steps with same number execute simultaneously
  - Example: Step 2a, 2b, 2c all at same time

### Step 3: Configure Conditions (Optional)

Set conditions for when workflow steps apply:

**Conditional Routing:**
- Based on form field values
- Based on submission amount
- Based on submitter's department
- Based on form data

**Example Conditions:**
```
IF amount > 10000 THEN require CFO approval
IF department = "Production" THEN skip manager approval
IF priority = "High" THEN escalate after 2 hours
```

### Step 4: Activate Workflow

1. Review all steps
2. Test workflow if possible
3. Click **"Activate"**
4. The workflow becomes active for new submissions
5. Only one workflow per form can be active

### Testing Workflows

Before activating:

1. Click **"Test Workflow"**
2. Enter sample data
3. Review calculated approval path
4. Verify approvers are correct
5. Check SLA times are reasonable

## Workflow Types

### Sequential Workflow

Steps execute one after another in order.

**Example - Standard Purchase Approval:**
1. **Step 1**: Supervisor Review
2. **Step 2**: Department Manager Approval
3. **Step 3**: Finance Approval
4. **Step 4**: General Manager Final Approval

**Flow:**
```
Submit → Supervisor → Manager → Finance → GM → Approved
```

**Best for:**
- Clear hierarchical approvals
- When each step builds on previous
- When order matters
- Simple approval chains

### Parallel Workflow

Multiple approvers review simultaneously.

**Example - Multi-department Review:**
- **Step 1**: All must approve simultaneously
  - Quality Assurance
  - Production Manager
  - Safety Officer

**Flow:**
```
Submit → [QA + Production + Safety] → Approved
```

**Best for:**
- Independent reviews
- Cross-functional approvals
- Faster approval process
- When order doesn't matter

### Hybrid Workflow

Combination of sequential and parallel steps.

**Example - Complex Project Approval:**
1. **Step 1**: Project Manager Review
2. **Step 2**: Parallel review by:
   - Technical Lead
   - Budget Officer
3. **Step 3**: Director Final Approval

**Flow:**
```
Submit → PM → [Technical + Budget] → Director → Approved
```

**Best for:**
- Complex approval requirements
- Multiple stakeholder input
- Balanced speed and thoroughness

### Conditional Workflow

Different paths based on submission data.

**Example - Amount-based Approval:**
```
IF amount < 5000:
  Manager → Approved
  
IF amount >= 5000 AND < 20000:
  Manager → Director → Approved
  
IF amount >= 20000:
  Manager → Director → CFO → CEO → Approved
```

**Best for:**
- Variable approval requirements
- Risk-based approvals
- Efficient resource use
- Compliance requirements

## SLA and Escalation

### Service Level Agreements

**Setting SLA:**
- Define maximum time for each step
- Measured in hours
- Starts when step becomes active
- Tracks business hours (optional)

**Example SLAs:**
- Supervisor: 24 hours
- Manager: 48 hours
- Director: 72 hours

### Escalation Process

**When Escalates:**
- SLA deadline passes
- Escalation is enabled on step
- Approver hasn't acted

**Escalation Actions:**
- Email notification to escalation contact
- Notification to approver's manager
- Dashboard alert
- Optional auto-approve (if configured)

**Best Practices:**
- Set realistic SLA times
- Allow buffer for holidays/weekends
- Configure appropriate escalation contacts
- Monitor escalation frequency
