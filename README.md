## Security Considerations

### File Upload Security
- File type validation and sanitization
- Virus scanning integration ready
- Secure file storage with access controls
- Automatic image optimization and watermarking

### Data Protection
- Encrypted sensitive data storage
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Role-based access control
- Session security with CSRF protection

### Performance Optimization
- Redis caching for improved response times
- Background job processing for heavy operations
- Optimized database queries with eager loading
- CDN-ready asset compilation

## Production Deployment

### Server Configuration
1. Configure web server (Apache/Nginx) for Laravel
2. Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS
3. Configure file permissions (storage and bootstrap/cache directories)
4. Set up database with proper user permissions
5. Configure Redis for caching and queues
6. Set up mail server for notifications

### Monitoring
- Set up application monitoring (logs, performance)
- Monitor queue processing and failures
- Track approval workflow performance
- Monitor file storage usage
- Monitor scheduled task execution (maintenance work orders)

### Backup Strategy
- Database backups (daily recommended)
- File storage backups
- Configuration backups
- Disaster recovery procedures

### Scheduled Tasks & Artisan Commands

The system uses Laravel's task scheduler for automated operations:

#### Available Artisan Commands

**Maintenance Management:**
```bash
# Generate work orders from overdue maintenance schedules
php artisan maintenance:generate-work-orders
```

**Notification Testing:**
```bash
# Send test WhatsApp notification
php artisan whatsapp:test [chatId]

# Example: Test with specific chat ID
php artisan whatsapp:test 62811337678@c.us
```

**System Management:**
```bash
# Inspiration quote (built-in Laravel command)
php artisan inspire
```

#### Automatic Work Order Generation

Runs daily at midnight (Asia/Jakarta) when enabled:
- Checks overdue maintenance schedules
- Creates work orders automatically
- Prevents duplicate work orders
- Logs all operations
- Currently **disabled by default** for safety (see `routes/console.php`)

**To enable automatic generation:**
1. Uncomment the schedule block in `routes/console.php`
2. Ensure this cron entry exists on your server:
   ```bash
   * * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

See [Maintenance Scheduling Guide](MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULING_GUIDE.md) for detailed information.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

**PHP Standards:**
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use strict typing: `declare(strict_types=1);`
- All classes should be final unless designed for inheritance
- Use explicit return type declarations
- Follow SOLID principles

**Laravel Best Practices:**
- Controllers should be final and read-only (no property mutations)
- Use dependency injection in methods, not constructors
- Keep controllers thin, use services for business logic
- Use Form Requests for validation
- Use Eloquent ORM and Query Builder over raw SQL
- Implement proper error handling and logging

**Frontend Standards:**
- Server-side validation is primary
- JavaScript only for UI enhancement
- Use Bootstrap 5 classes for styling
- Follow Tabler template conventions
- Minimize JavaScript dependencies

### File Organization

**Naming Conventions:**
- Models: Singular, PascalCase (e.g., `User.php`, `WorkOrder.php`)
- Controllers: Plural, PascalCase with Controller suffix (e.g., `UsersController.php`)
- Views: snake_case (e.g., `work_orders/show.blade.php`)
- Database columns: snake_case
- Methods: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

**Directory Structure:**
- Models in `app/Models/`
- Controllers in `app/Http/Controllers/`
- Services in `app/Services/`
- Helpers in `app/Helpers/`
- Views in `resources/views/`
- Migrations in `database/migrations/`

### Testing

Run tests using Pest PHP:
```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test file
php artisan test tests/Feature/FormTest.php

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage
```
