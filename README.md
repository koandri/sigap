## Database Schema

### Core Models (33 models)

**Form Management:**
- `Form`, `FormVersion`, `FormField`, `FormFieldOption`
- `FormSubmission`, `FormAnswer`
- `ApprovalWorkflow`, `ApprovalFlowStep`, `ApprovalLog`

**Manufacturing & Inventory:**
- `Warehouse`, `WarehouseShelf`, `ShelfPosition`, `PositionItem`
- `Item`, `ItemCategory`
- `BomTemplate`, `BomIngredient`, `BomType`

**Maintenance (CMMS):**
- `Asset`, `AssetCategory`, `AssetDocument`
- `MaintenanceSchedule`, `MaintenanceType`, `MaintenanceLog`
- `WorkOrder`, `WorkOrderAction`, `WorkOrderPart`, `WorkOrderPhoto`, `WorkOrderProgressLog`

**User Management:**
- `User`, `Role`, `Permission`, `Department`

All models follow Laravel best practices:
- Final classes to prevent inheritance
- Explicit type declarations
- Eloquent relationships properly defined
- Mass assignment protection
- Proper timestamp handling

## Security Considerations

### File Upload Security
- File type validation and sanitization
- Virus scanning integration ready
- Secure file storage with access controls
- Automatic image optimization and watermarking

### Data Protection
- Encrypted sensitive data storage
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Role-based access control
- Session security with CSRF protection

### Performance Optimization
- Redis caching for improved response times
- Background job processing for heavy operations
- Optimized database queries with eager loading
- CDN-ready asset compilation

## Production Deployment

### Server Configuration
1. Configure web server (Apache/Nginx) for Laravel
2. Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS
3. Configure file permissions (storage and bootstrap/cache directories)
4. Set up database with proper user permissions
5. Configure Redis for caching and queues
6. Set up mail server for notifications

### Monitoring
- Set up application monitoring (logs, performance)
- Monitor queue processing and failures
- Track approval workflow performance
- Monitor file storage usage
- Monitor scheduled task execution (maintenance work orders)

### Backup Strategy
- Database backups (daily recommended)
- File storage backups
- Configuration backups
- Disaster recovery procedures

### Scheduled Tasks & Artisan Commands

The system uses Laravel's task scheduler for automated operations:

#### Available Artisan Commands

**Maintenance Management:**
```bash
# Generate work orders from overdue maintenance schedules
php artisan maintenance:generate-work-orders
```

**System Management:**
```bash
# Inspiration quote (built-in Laravel command)
php artisan inspire
```

#### Automatic Work Order Generation

Runs daily at midnight (Asia/Jakarta) when enabled:
- Checks overdue maintenance schedules
- Creates work orders automatically
- Prevents duplicate work orders
- Logs all operations
- Currently **disabled by default** for safety (see `routes/console.php`)

**To enable automatic generation:**
1. Uncomment the schedule block in `routes/console.php`
2. Ensure this cron entry exists on your server:
   ```bash
   * * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

See [Maintenance Scheduling Guide](MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULING_GUIDE.md) for detailed information.
