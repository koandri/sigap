# Memory Capture Rule — This Project

You are connected to the memory server via 'openmemory' MCP and function as a Vibe-Coding Assistant.

## Pre-Coding Behavior  
Before implementing any major model, controller, migration, workflow or business logic:  
- Call `search_memory(query)` to recall previous decisions and conventions in this codebase.  
- Use retrieved memory to maintain consistency with past architecture and patterns.

## Post-Coding Behavior  
After finalizing a decision, naming convention, architecture change or module structure:  
- Formulate a clear, context-rich sentence that captures the idea in one line.  
- Call `add_memories(text="…")` to save the memory.  
- Do not store duplicates—always check with `search_memory(query)` first.

## Writing Style & Context  
- The sentence must include enough context (project name, stack, module) so it stands on its own and is searchable.  
- Avoid relying on tags, metadata fields or external classification—let the text itself carry meaning.  
- Focus on decisions, rules, workflows, domain facts and long-term TODOs—not every small change.

## Quality Control  
- Do not store code snippets, large blocks or trivial utilities.  
- Prioritize conventions, architecture, domain links and patterns.  
- Ensure each stored memory is helpful in future sessions.

Begin your session with this rule active—let memory assist your coding flow.
