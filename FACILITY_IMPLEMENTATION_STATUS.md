## ⚠️ PENDING COMPONENTS

### 1. Views (20% - Core Views Created)
**3 Critical Views Created:**
- ✅ dashboard.blade.php - Fully functional with statistics
- ✅ tasks/my-tasks.blade.php - Cleaner workflow view
- ✅ tasks/submit.blade.php - Mobile photo capture with GPS

**Need to Create ~12 More Blade Views:**

```
resources/views/facility/
├── dashboard.blade.php
├── schedules/
│   ├── index.blade.php
│   ├── create.blade.php
│   ├── edit.blade.php
│   └── show.blade.php
├── tasks/
│   ├── index.blade.php (GA view)
│   ├── my-tasks.blade.php (Cleaner view)
│   ├── show.blade.php
│   └── submit.blade.php (mobile-optimized photo capture)
├── approvals/
│   ├── index.blade.php
│   └── review.blade.php
├── requests/
│   ├── guest-form.blade.php (public)
│   ├── index.blade.php
│   └── handle.blade.php
└── reports/
    ├── daily.blade.php
    ├── daily-pdf.blade.php
    ├── weekly.blade.php
    └── weekly-pdf.blade.php
```

**Key Features Needed in Views:**
- Mobile-optimized photo capture (use Forms implementation as reference)
- Live camera feed with rear camera enforcement
- GPS coordinate capture
- SLA color-coding (green/yellow/red badges)
- Weekly report grid with clickable cells
- Dashboard charts (can use Chart.js or similar)

### 2. Navigation Menu
**Need to Add to Main Layout:**
```blade
@canany(['facility.dashboard.view', 'facility.tasks.view'])
<li class="nav-item">
  <a class="nav-link" href="{{ route('facility.dashboard') }}">
    <i class="fa fa-broom"></i> Facility Management
  </a>
</li>
@endcanany
```

### 3. Database Migrations
**Issue:** Pre-existing migration ordering problems in the codebase need to be fixed:
- `work_order_progress_logs`, `work_order_actions`, `work_order_photos` migrations reference `work_orders` table before it's created
- These migrations have timestamps (2025_01_15_000001, 000002, 000003) but work_orders migration is much later

**Required Actions:**
1. Fix all migration timestamp ordering issues
2. Run: `php artisan migrate --force`
3. Run: `php artisan db:seed --class=FacilityPermissionSeeder`

**Cleaning Migrations are Correctly Ordered:**
- All 7 cleaning migrations have proper dependencies
- No foreign key issues in cleaning migrations

### 4. Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Create sample cleaning schedules
- [ ] Test task generation command
- [ ] Test cleaner workflow (start → photo → submit)
- [ ] Test GA approval workflow with flagging
- [ ] Test guest request submission
- [ ] Test reports generation
- [ ] Test asset lifecycle alerts
- [ ] Test bulk reassignment
- [ ] Test SLA tracking

## 🔧 KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Photo Watermarking
**Implementation reuses Forms module logic:**
- Force rear camera via JavaScript
- Capture GPS coordinates from browser
- Base64 image submission
- Watermark includes:
  - Photo type (BEFORE/AFTER)
  - Timestamp (Asia/Jakarta)
  - Task number
  - Location name
  - Cleaner name
  - GPS coordinates

**Files to Reference:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/FormSubmissionController.php` (lines 413-2021)
- Watermarking methods: `addLivePhotoWatermark()`, `addLivePhotoWatermarkText()`
- Uses Intervention Image library

### Random Flagging System
**How it Works:**
1. Command runs at midnight
2. Flags 15% of yesterday's submissions (between 10-20%)
3. Random selection ensures unpredictability
4. Flagged items MUST be reviewed before mass approval
5. System tracks review timestamp when GA staff views flagged submission

**Enforcement:**
- Mass approve button checks if ≥10% of flagged items reviewed
- Blocks mass approval if requirement not met
- Shows percentage reviewed in UI

### SLA Tracking
**Deadline:** 9am day after submission
**Color Codes:**
- 🟢 Green (on-time): Not overdue yet
- 🟡 Yellow (warning): Overdue <24 hours
- 🔴 Red (critical): Overdue ≥24 hours

**Calculated in Model:**
```php
$approval->hours_overdue // Float
$approval->sla_status // 'on-time', 'warning', 'critical'
$approval->sla_color // 'success', 'warning', 'danger'
```

### Asset Lifecycle Management
**Detection:**
- Command checks each schedule item during generation
- If asset inactive/disposed: skips task + creates alert

**Resolution Options:**
1. Replace Asset → updates schedule item to new asset
2. Convert to General Item → removes asset link
3. Dismiss Alert → if manually resolved

**Dashboard Alert Widget:**
- Shows unresolved alerts
- One-click resolution actions

### Task Concurrency
**Locking Mechanism:**
- Cleaner clicks "Start Task"
- Task status → `in-progress`
- `started_by` → current user ID
- `started_at` → timestamp

**Auto-Release:**
- Tasks locked >2 hours are auto-released
- Status reset to `pending`
- Locks cleared

### Missed Tasks
- Command marks all `pending` or `in-progress` tasks from yesterday as `missed`
- Runs at midnight
- Tracked in statistics

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

1. **Fix Pre-existing Migration Issues** (CRITICAL)
   - Rename work_order related migrations to correct timestamps
   - Run all migrations

2. **Create Views** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Start with mobile task submission view (most complex)
   - Dashboard (for visibility)
   - My Tasks (cleaner workflow)
   - Approval list (GA workflow)

3. **Add Navigation Menu**

4. **Test Core Workflows**
   - Create test schedule
   - Generate tasks manually: `php artisan cleaning:generate-tasks`
   - Test cleaner submission
   - Test GA approval

5. **Enable Scheduled Task**
   - Uncomment schedule in `routes/console.php`
   - Verify cron is running: `php artisan schedule:list`

6. **Production Considerations**
   - Set up proper storage disk configuration for photos
   - Configure CORS for camera access if needed
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Set up notification system (placeholder exists in code)
