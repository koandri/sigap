# Facility Management - Complete Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Navigation Menu Added!

The Facility Management module is now accessible from the sidebar menu (appears for authorized users only).

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup & Testing (15 Minutes)

Follow these steps in order to test the entire system.

### Step 1: Run Migrations & Seeders

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/andri/Documents/projects/sigap

# Run migrations (if not already done)
php artisan migrate

# Seed roles and permissions
php artisan db:seed --class=FacilityPermissionSeeder
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Facility Management roles and permissions seeded successfully
```

---

### Step 2: Assign Roles to Test Users

Open Tinker:
```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Then run these commands:

```php
// Find users (adjust IDs based on your database)
$users = User::all();
$users->pluck('name', 'id'); // See available users

// Assign Cleaner role (example: user ID 2)
$cleaner = User::find(2);
$cleaner->assignRole('Cleaner');
echo "‚úÖ {$cleaner->name} is now a Cleaner\n";

// Assign General Affairs role (example: user ID 3)
$ga = User::find(3);
$ga->assignRole('General Affairs');
echo "‚úÖ {$ga->name} is now General Affairs\n";

// Super Admin can access everything too
$admin = User::find(1);
echo "‚úÖ {$admin->name} has Super Admin access\n";

exit
```

---

### Step 3: Create Test Data

#### 3A. Create Locations (if needed)

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Check existing locations
Location::all()->pluck('name', 'id');

// If you need to create test locations
$office = Location::create([
    'name' => 'Main Office',
    'description' => 'Office building first floor',
    'is_active' => true
]);

$warehouse = Location::create([
    'name' => 'Warehouse Area',
    'description' => 'Storage warehouse',
    'is_active' => true
]);

echo "‚úÖ Locations created\n";
exit
```

#### 3B. Create Cleaning Schedules

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Get a location
$location = Location::first();

// Create a Daily Cleaning Schedule
$dailySchedule = CleaningSchedule::create([
    'location_id' => $location->id,
    'name' => 'Daily Office Cleaning',
    'description' => 'Regular daily cleaning tasks for the office',
    'frequency_type' => 'daily',
    'frequency_config' => json_encode(['interval' => 1]),
    'is_active' => true
]);

// Add items to the schedule
$dailySchedule->items()->create([
    'item_name' => 'Sweep floor',
    'item_description' => 'Sweep all floor areas',
    'order' => 1
]);

$dailySchedule->items()->create([
    'item_name' => 'Mop floor',
    'item_description' => 'Mop after sweeping',
    'order' => 2
]);

$dailySchedule->items()->create([
    'item_name' => 'Empty trash bins',
    'item_description' => 'Collect and dispose trash',
    'order' => 3
]);

$dailySchedule->items()->create([
    'item_name' => 'Dust all surfaces',
    'item_description' => 'Wipe down desks and tables',
    'order' => 4
]);

echo "‚úÖ Daily schedule created with {$dailySchedule->items->count()} items\n";

// Create a Weekly Cleaning Schedule
$weeklySchedule = CleaningSchedule::create([
    'location_id' => $location->id,
    'name' => 'Weekly Deep Cleaning',
    'description' => 'Deep cleaning every Monday',
    'frequency_type' => 'weekly',
    'frequency_config' => json_encode(['days' => [1]]), // Monday
    'is_active' => true
]);

$weeklySchedule->items()->create([
    'item_name' => 'Clean windows',
    'item_description' => 'Wash all windows inside and out',
    'order' => 1
]);

$weeklySchedule->items()->create([
    'item_name' => 'Polish floors',
    'item_description' => 'Deep polish all floor areas',
    'order' => 2
]);

echo "‚úÖ Weekly schedule created with {$weeklySchedule->items->count()} items\n";

// Optional: Create schedule with asset reference
$asset = Asset::where('status', 'active')->first();
if ($asset) {
    $schedule = CleaningSchedule::create([
        'location_id' => $asset->location_id,
        'name' => 'Asset Cleaning - ' . $asset->name,
        'description' => 'Cleaning for specific asset',
        'frequency_type' => 'daily',
        'frequency_config' => json_encode(['interval' => 1]),
        'is_active' => true
    ]);
    
    $schedule->items()->create([
        'asset_id' => $asset->id,
        'item_name' => 'Clean ' . $asset->name,
        'item_description' => 'Wipe and inspect',
        'order' => 1
    ]);
    
    echo "‚úÖ Asset-linked schedule created for {$asset->name}\n";
}

exit
```

---

### Step 4: Generate Tasks

```bash
php artisan cleaning:generate-tasks
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Generating cleaning tasks for 2024-10-17...
‚úì Generated X tasks from Y schedules
‚úì Marked X missed tasks
‚úì Flagged X submissions for review
```

**Verify tasks created:**
```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
$today = today();
$tasks = CleaningTask::whereDate('scheduled_date', $today)->get();
echo "‚úÖ {$tasks->count()} tasks generated for today\n";

// Show task details
$tasks->each(function($task) {
    echo "- {$task->task_number}: {$task->item_name} @ {$task->location->name} (Status: {$task->status})\n";
});

exit
```

## üìä Verify Data in Database

Use Tinker to inspect data:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Check schedules
echo "Schedules: " . CleaningSchedule::count() . "\n";
echo "Schedule Items: " . CleaningScheduleItem::count() . "\n";

// Check today's tasks
$today = today();
$tasks = CleaningTask::whereDate('scheduled_date', $today);
echo "Today's Tasks: " . $tasks->count() . "\n";
echo "- Pending: " . $tasks->where('status', 'pending')->count() . "\n";
echo "- In Progress: " . $tasks->where('status', 'in-progress')->count() . "\n";
echo "- Completed: " . $tasks->where('status', 'completed')->count() . "\n";

// Check submissions
echo "\nSubmissions: " . CleaningSubmission::count() . "\n";

// Check approvals
$approvals = CleaningApproval::all();
echo "Approvals: " . $approvals->count() . "\n";
echo "- Pending: " . $approvals->where('status', 'pending')->count() . "\n";
echo "- Flagged: " . $approvals->where('is_flagged_for_review', true)->count() . "\n";
echo "- Approved: " . $approvals->where('status', 'approved')->count() . "\n";

// Check requests

exit
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Navigation menu not showing?
```bash
# Clear cache
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

### No tasks generated?
- Check if schedules exist: `CleaningSchedule::where('is_active', true)->count()`
- Verify frequency config is correct
- Run command manually: `php artisan cleaning:generate-tasks`

### Photos not uploading?
- Check storage permissions: `php artisan storage:link`
- Verify storage disk 'sigap' configured in `config/filesystems.php`
- Check camera permissions in browser

### SLA colors not showing?
- Verify task completed yesterday (deadline is 9am next day)
- Check approval status: should be 'pending' for SLA to apply

### Mass approve not working?
- Check flagged count: Must review at least 10% of flagged tasks
- View flagged: `CleaningApproval::where('is_flagged_for_review', true)->count()`
- Review at least 1 flagged task manually first
